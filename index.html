        <h1>Hello Everyone!</h1>
        <p>I'm just trying to learn html and stuff.</p>
        <p>If you know anything about web development, maybe hit me up?</p>

        <h2>Learning the two types of <i>italics</i> and bold</h2>

        <p>
            Apparently, the <i>i</i> tag is for visual only;
            I watched the movie called, <i>The Godfather</i>.
            The <em>em</em> tag is for when you want to emphasize;
            I <em>watched</em> the movie called, The Godfather.
            So together, we get:
            I <em>watched</em> the movie called, <i>The Godfather</i>.
        </p>
        <p> 
            As for the bolding tags, the <strong>strong</strong> tag is used to
            create importance or urgency, while the <bold>b</bold> tag is neutral.
            An example of using the strong tag would be: <strong>Caution!</strong> I have a bad case of diarreah?
            Ex. of bold tag would be: I want to bold the next sentence just for fun.
            <b>blah blah blah blah...</b>
            Fun!
        </p>
        <h2> Talking about lists; the ul, ol, dl tags. </h2>

        <ul>
            <li> work it </li>
            <li> make it </li>
            <li> do it </li>
            <li> makes us </li>
            <li> harder </li>
            <li> better </li>
            <li> faster </li>
            <li> stronger </li>
        </ul>
        
        <ol>
            <li> cut a hole in a box </li>
            <li> put your junk in that box </li>
            <li> make her open the box </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                I actually don't like thinking. I think people think I like to think a lot.
                 And I don't. I do not like to think at all.
            </p>
            <cite>- Kanye </cite>
