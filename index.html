                        <h4>Unknown Space Wax</h4>
                        <p>I think this is the first track I made using the free FL studio version.
                            That's why you hear the drums cut out near the final section.
                        </p>
                        <p>Apparently, I made this back in early 2018.</p>

                        <h4>Tetris remix</h4>
                        <p>I made this for a school film project. If I remember correctly, I was still using
                            the free version of FL studio and I was also using the free
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kvraudio.com/product/synth1-by-daichi-laboratory-ichiro-toda">
                                Synth1</a> plugin.
                            I basically copied the style of Danny Baranowsky from his

                        <p> Another remix that I basically copied off of Danny Baranowsky. I believe this time
                            I had the Fruity edition of FL. Still using Synth1 plugin.

                        <p> Surprisingly, this is an original track that I did aside from the fact that I copied Lena Raine's
                            bass on 'in risk we trust' from her

                        <p> Out of all the tracks I've done, I think this is my favourite.
                            It has always been on my mind to do an orchestral track since I grew up playing the violin.
                            Seeing all the instruments come together was one of the greatest feelings I've ever felt.
